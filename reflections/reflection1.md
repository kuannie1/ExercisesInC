# Reflection 1: Making A Web Server and Learning C
My personal learning goal to master C was accomplished this sprint. Most of my realizations and clarifications were realized near the end of sprint 1 and beginning of sprint 2. During that period between sprint 1 and 2, I got to know the concepts behind C better with Ben's stacks review and Sophie's clarifications.
My work habits definitely changed throughout this sprint as I got used to this eduscrum method. Before, I didn't really know how to budget my time for SoftSys, but now I usually work on more SoftSys over the weekend and on Mondays because Sophie holds Office Hours on Monday evenings. I think my team definitely had a hard time adjusting to the eduscrum system. We added another great member pretty late into the semester, but some people have been sick or involved in other large activities (so... bad timing!). We're still adjusting, and I'm sure we'll get the rhythm of this class soon.
I wish I could have done more for the team project. I read through some of the chapters we carded to get the concepts but I would often stop at the first error I got (when trying out the examples). Recently, I've become more familiar with C, so I have been able to google my error messages and ask better questions about how to solve them. I tried to jump right to the Web Server Exercise, but I had to ask Ben to understand how to compile everything correctly. This realization made me think of what to improve on and plan for the rest of the project.
From now on, I'm planning to work faster and chronologically (not sure if this is the right word, I meant working from fundamental to advanced chapters) in Head First C and lay off on the ThinkOS for now. I think the Head First C chapters are more essential for now, and I need to familiarize myself with C ASAP.
