# Reflection 0: Beginning of Semester
I think my first few days of SoftSys have been interesting. It really narrowed my goals for this course and introduced me to the __Eduscrum__ method, which I'm still trying to understand. Let me elaborate on both the goals and the Eduscrum experience.

## Individual Learning Goals
Before my first class, I didn't really have any specific learning goals. I actually planned to be passive and take in whatever content Allen and Ben were going to lecture us. Unfortunately I missed the first class, so I missed the official introduction. Although I read all the Eduscrum documents, I did not start on the deliverables until I had a full team in the 2nd class. 

I eventually decided to focus on mastering the C language and its roles in how computer networks and OSes work. I've always knew how important C was to how computers worked, but I didn't know how hard it is to learn. I think I'll take a long while to get use to this language and learning style, but it's worth a try. 

## Team Learning Goals
My team was mostly in the same page as me, because we all missed the first class. We used our time today to reflect on why we took this class and possible group goals for this class. After sharing our personal goals, we decided to find overlaps within them to make our team learning goal, which was to learn more about OSes. 

After deliberating about our team goals, we went right to work with organizing the trello board and assigned me to the scrum master. However, we haven't divided the responsibilities because we're still trying to figure out what our project entails. This is the reason why we haven't populated our trello board with specific tasks, but we'll have a better idea later this week.

## Conclusion
I'm still apprehensive about learning so much material for the first project. I'm very unfamiliar with the C language and don't recognize many of the terms associated with Operating System and hardware. I do, however, believe that I'll complete my goals with the Eduscrum method with enough time.
